# How to use

1. Add the Multithreading.cs to your Unity project
2. Create an instance of the Multithreading class
3. Call a command form a sub-thread
4. Call the Execute method from a MonoBehaviour script

*Note that every time you queue a command you have to call the execute method*  
I recommend to call the execute method from an Update method
